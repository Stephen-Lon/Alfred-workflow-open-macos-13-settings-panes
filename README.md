Open macOS Settings Panes from list

# Note 

This workflow has been tested on macOS 15.0. If you are still using macOS 14 please use [version 2.7](https://github.com/Stephen-Lon/Alfred-workflow-open-macos-settings-panes/releases/tag/v2.7) of this workflow.

# Usage

This workflow lists, in response to the user configurable `syset` keyword, various macOS System Preference panes (which are still called `Preference panes` even under macOS 14) to which there is programable access. When you select the relevant pane from the searchable list simply press <kbd>‚èé</kbd> to display the pane. Note that you can leave a space after the keyword and type the initial letter(s) of the pane you want in order quickly to jump to that pane.

From version 2.5 of the workflow Alfred learns from used items to bring them to the top of the list.

# Note

The `Mouse`, `Game Controller` and `VPN` panes will not appear unless and until you have connected to one of those relevant devices.

# Acknowledgment

I am indebted to comments on [this Github post](https://gist.github.com/rmcdongit/f66ff91e0dad78d4d6346a75ded4b751?permalink_comment_id=4258811) for enabling me to find identifiers for various Preference panes.
