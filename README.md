# Alfred-workflow-open-macos-settings-panes
Open macOS Settings Panes from list

# Note 

This workflow has been tested on macOS 14.4 and will not work on macOS versions prior to macOS 13. It is possible future changes (whether in macOS 14 or later) will stop this workflow working—either partially or fully.

# Usage

This workflow lists, in response to the user configurable `syset` keyword, various macOS System Preference panes (which are still called `Preference panes` even under macOS 14) to which there is programable access. When you select the relevant pane from the alphabetical, searchable list simply press <kbd>⏎</kbd> to display the pane. Note that you can leave a space after the keyword and type the initial letter(s) of the pane you want in order quickly to jump to that pane.

I have chosen to keep the list of panes in alphabetical order—rather than allowing Alfred to sort them based on usage—as they seem to me easier to browse in that order. If you feel there are too many panes listed by all means delete from the list filter those you do not wish to see (and of course you can search in the workflow for the pane you need).

# Note

The `Mouse`, `Game Controller` and `VPN` panes will not appear unless and until you have connected to one of those relevant devices.


# Acknowledgment

I am indebted to comments on [this Github post](https://gist.github.com/rmcdongit/f66ff91e0dad78d4d6346a75ded4b751?permalink_comment_id=4258811) for enabling me to find identifiers for various Preference panes.
